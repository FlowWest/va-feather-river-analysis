# Overview

The goal of this document is guide the development of habitat suitability analyses including (1) explore the distributions of and correlations between key variables, (2) testing key methods

Feather River will be used a case study location. There are two relevant datasets (1) mini snorkel data, and (2) the intermediate level ongoing snorkel survey. These data are collecting utilizing different methodologies and part of these analyses will explore the differences between these two data collection methods and resulting habitat.

```{r, include = F}

# google cloud set up
gcs_auth(json_file = Sys.getenv("GCS_AUTH_FILE"))
gcs_global_bucket(bucket = Sys.getenv("GCS_DEFAULT_BUCKET"))

               overwrite = TRUE)

combined_snorkel <- read_csv(here::here("data-raw", "combined_feather_snorkel_data.csv"))

# Mini Snorkel

**Description of sampling** 

- 136 locations were sampled between March and August 2001 (approx 24 per month)
- 4,891 quadrats (approx 36 per location)

*TODO*
- confirm the scale of cover/substrate measurements (for the entire quadrat fish was observed?)

```{r}
# TODO
# We are missing 76 locations from the location table
check_location <- mini_snorkel_raw |> 
  left_join(location_raw |> 
              select(location_table_id) |> 
              mutate(location = "yes")) |> 
  filter(is.na(location)) |> 
  distinct(location_table_id)

mini_snorkel_raw |> distinct(micro_hab_data_tbl_id)
mini_snorkel_raw |> group_by(location_table_id) |> summarize(n_quadrats = length(unique(micro_hab_data_tbl_id)))
```


**Key Variables**
 
 - depth: depth, dist_to_bottom
 - velocity: velocity, focal_velocity
 - count: treated as abesense/presence or actual count
 - cover: percent_no_cover_inchannel, percent_small_woody_cover_inchannel, percent_large_woody_cover_inchannel, percent_submerged_aquatic_veg_instream, percent_undercut_bank, percent_no_cover_overhead, percent_half_meter_overhead, percent_cover_more_than_half_meter
 - substrate: percent_fine_substrate, percent_sand_substrate, percent_small_gravel_substrate, percent_large_gravel_substrate, percent_cobble_substrate, percent_boulder_substrate
 
**Data Processing**

- Species: Analyses should be performed for chinook and steelhead separately or maybe if we determine there is a strong species affect can lump together. 
- Fork length: If there is a wide variation in fork length and ruleset should be use to differentiate between lifestages and analyses should be performed separately for each analyses. 
- Reach/location: Some analyses have removed reaches where no fish are observed.
- Absense/presence: May want to consider random selecting from the "unoccupied" observations to simulate paired random selection (?)
- Cover: These fields can be treated in many different ways. (1) Each can function as percent cover (though the "no cover" should be removed because they are different). (2) They can be transformed to a binary variable (cover/no cover), (3) two binary variables (instream, overhead), (4) They can also be treated as multiple binary variables where percent greater than 20% is counted as presence

## Distributions of key variables

```
### percent cover by transect code

The following plots summarize percent cover by type and transect code to help describe the types of habitats surveyed. This information needs to be summarized better.

**small woody cover**
```{r}
mini_snorkel_raw |> 
  filter(percent_small_woody_cover_inchannel > 0) |> 
  distinct(transect_code, .keep_all = T) |>

  geom_col()
```
```{r}
mini_snorkel_raw |>

  distinct(transect_code, .keep_all = T) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = transect_code, y = percent_large_woody_cover_inchannel)) +
  geom_col()
```

  geom_col()
```

### cover - presence/absence

We transformed cover to presence/absence. If any of the cover types are > 20% then cover is present.

**instream cover presence (1) and absence (0) for Chinook salmon**

```{r}
mini_snorkel_cover_presence <- mini_snorkel_raw |> 
  mutate(instream_cover = as.factor(ifelse(percent_small_woody_cover_inchannel > 20 | percent_large_woody_cover_inchannel > 20 | percent_submerged_aquatic_veg_inchannel > 20 | percent_undercut_bank, 1, 0)),
         overhead_cover = as.factor(ifelse(percent_cover_half_meter_overhead > 20 | percent_cover_more_than_half_meter_overhead > 20, 1, 0)))

mini_snorkel_cover_presence |>

  group_by(instream_cover) |> 
  tally() |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = instream_cover, y = n)) +

```

**overhead cover presence (1) and absence (0) for Chinook salmon**

  group_by(instream_cover) |> 
  tally() |>

  geom_col()
```

**overhead cover presence (1) and absence (0) for Steelhead**

```{r}
mini_snorkel_cover_presence |> 
  filter(grepl("Steelhead", species)) |> 
  group_by(overhead_cover) |> 
  tally() |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = overhead_cover, y = n)) +
  geom_col()
```


```{r, include = F}

  filter(is_present == T, cover_type != "percent_no_cover_inchannel")

unique(mini_snorkel_format$cover_type)
mini_snorkel_chinook <- mini_snorkel_format |> 
  filter(species == "Chinook salmon" | is.na(species))

# choose dominant cover type

relative_abundance_chinook <- mini_snorkel_chinook |> 
  mutate(total_chinook = sum(count, na.rm = T),
         relative_abundance = count/total_chinook)

relative_abundance_chinook |> 
  group_by(cover_type) |> 
  summarize(relative_abundance = sum(relative_abundance)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = cover_type, y = relative_abundance)) +

```

```{r}
mini_percent_cover <- mini_snorkel_raw |> 
  select(percent_no_cover_inchannel, percent_small_woody_cover_inchannel,
                        percent_large_woody_cover_inchannel, percent_submerged_aquatic_veg_inchannel,
                        percent_undercut_bank, percent_no_cover_overhead, percent_cover_half_meter_overhead, percent_cover_more_than_half_meter_overhead)
  
```

```{r}
library("psych")
pairs.panels(mini_percent_cover)
pairs.panels(chinook_for_cluster_cover)
```
## Correlations

Checked the correlations between cover and substrate and did not find any highly correlated.

No correlations between distance to bottom and velocty.

### Cover

Percent no cover in channel is highly inversely correlated with submerged aquatic vegetation.

Percent no cover overhead is highly inversely correlated with cover overhead.

```{r, include = F}
mini_percent_cover <- mini_snorkel_raw |> 
  select(percent_no_cover_inchannel, percent_small_woody_cover_inchannel,
                        percent_large_woody_cover_inchannel, percent_submerged_aquatic_veg_inchannel,
                        percent_undercut_bank, percent_no_cover_overhead, percent_cover_half_meter_overhead, percent_cover_more_than_half_meter_overhead, dist_to_bottom, velocity)

mini_percent_substrate <- mini_snorkel_raw |> 
  select(percent_fine_substrate, percent_sand_substrate, percent_small_gravel_substrate, percent_large_gravel_substrate, percent_cobble_substrate, percent_boulder_substrate, dist_to_bottom, velocity)
```

```{r}
library("psych")
pairs.panels(mini_percent_cover)
```

### Substrate

None of the percent cover substrate variables are correlated.

```{r}
pairs.panels(mini_percent_substrate)
```

## Cluster analysis

The goal of the cluster analysis is to identify groupings of fish observations and what best describes those groupings. Unlike typical habitat analysis this will just focus on characteristics of fish observations.

**Key variables**

- date (or month)
- species (may decide to filter to just Chinook and Steelhead)
- count (note that this variable does not seem to be working well)
- dist_to_bottom
- fl_mm (note that this variable does not seem to be working well)
- focal_velocity
- some measure of cover
- some measure of substrate

```{r, include = F}
# 1. Define the dataset - select the variables to include

# Todo need to decide if it is an issue if the percent cover values add to 1

cluster_data <- mini_snorkel_raw |> 
  filter(count > 0) |> # filter to only include fish observations. i think makes the most sense because we are asking are there clusters of habitat characteristics that fish use 
  mutate(month = month(date),
         species_cat = case_when(species == "Chinook salmon" ~ 1,
                                 grepl("Steelhead", species) ~ 2,
                                 T ~ 3)) |> 
  select(dist_to_bottom, 
         focal_velocity, 
         # percent_fine_substrate, # removed these for the time being
         # percent_sand_substrate, # removed these for the time being
         percent_small_gravel_substrate,
         percent_large_gravel_substrate,
         percent_cobble_substrate,
         percent_boulder_substrate,
         # percent_no_cover_inchannel, removing the no cover
         percent_small_woody_cover_inchannel, 
         percent_large_woody_cover_inchannel, 
         percent_submerged_aquatic_veg_inchannel,
         percent_undercut_bank, # percent_no_cover_overhead, 
         percent_cover_half_meter_overhead,
         #percent_cover_more_than_half_meter_overhead,
         surface_turbidity, 
         # count, 
         # fl_mm, 
         species_cat,
         #date,
         month) 
# cor(cluster_data) # check that there aren't any high correlations

# notes about what is working:
# dist, focal, substrate categories, cover categories (removed the no cover), month = 4 or 5 decent sized clusters
# adding count (as well as adding fl_mm) to the above results in one large cluster and one very small one and another small one
# adding species results in strange scree plot
# deleting month also results in strange scree plot

# if we remove all the substrate ones and add count, end up with 3 but one cluster with really small number
# if we then add fl_mm, we end up with 2 and one is really small
# same if we add species

# if we remove sand and fine and add species we get 3 clusters of decent size but if add fl_mm messes it up

# Run the hierarchical cluster analysis
clusters <- hclust(dist(cluster_data), method = "ward.D2")
# Dendrogram plot (need to make a prettier one)
# plot(clusters)
```

**Number of clusters**

Based on analysis of multiple indices, 3 clusters is the best fit. Note that this could be looked into further to confirm this is the best number of clusters.

```{r, include = F}
# Evaluating clusters

library(NbClust)
# currently not working to run all the indices so need to identify the ones that work
res <- NbClust(data = cluster_data, method = "ward.D2")

# hartigan = 6
# cindex = 14
# db = 5
# silhouette = 5
# ratkowsky = 5
# ball = 3
# ptbiserial = 6
# gap = 2
# frey = 1
# mcclain = 2
# dunn = 2
NbClust(data = cluster_data, method = "ward.D2", index = "dunn")
# Function for scree plot
scree <- function(hclust.obj, max.size = 12) {
temp <- with(hclust.obj, cbind(height, merge))
colnames(temp) <- c("Height", "JoinsThis", "WithThis")
plot(x = max.size:1,
     y = temp[(nrow(temp)-( max.size -1)):nrow(temp), 1],
     xlab = "Number of groups", ylab = "Height",
     main = hclust.obj $call, type = "b")
tail(temp, max.size)
}
scree(hclust.obj = clusters)
```

```{r, include = F}

```

## Occupancy modeling

The goal here is to model presence/absence in a hierarchical bayesian framework.

# Intermediate Snorkel

## Data wrangling fixes for the intermediate snorkel data

- Cover and substrate have multiple codes in some years. Currently, some are decoded and are others are coded. Need to keep all uncoded
- Need to map cover and substrate to a hierarchy (e.g. Gard has a cover and substrate coding system)
- We should double check the data Erin pulled from the database - was this filered to Chinook? We want all species
- section_name, units_covered, unit, location, section_type, unit_type, section_number are all related to location. We need to do a better job getting these organized.
